## Pull Requests

You'll need to sign off your commits, before we could accept your pull requests.

### Code Style

This project adheres to coding conventions [`Effective Go`](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go), please make sure your code follows it either.

### Code review

We recommend you describe what your PR do in the PR's comment box, that will save a lot of time for you and us.

Before you call someone to review your code, check the [CI](https://github.com/horizoncd/horizon/actions) is passed.

### CI

We host CI on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/horizoncd/horizon/actions), we will make sure PR pass tests before we can merge it.

These two kind of tests: `lint` and `unit test`

`lint` tests if your code matches our code conventions, please consult [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) and [lint config](./.golangci.yml)

`unit test` runs all the test in code, and the code coverage should not less than 70 percent.

Try your best to keep every function has been tested, it keeps the function behaves as intended.
